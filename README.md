## Folder Structure

```
â”œâ”€â”€ packages
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ common-assets # Assets files (png, jpeg, json, etc)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ common-graphql # GraphQL Types, Documents, Hooks, etc
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ common-locale # Translation locale files
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ui-native # React Native UI Components
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ui-theme # theme configuration accross mobile & web (cms coming soon)
â””â”€â”€ projects
    â”œâ”€â”€ cms # cms panel
    â”œâ”€â”€ mobile # end user mobile application
    â””â”€â”€ web # end user web application

```

---

## Assets

If you have common assets that want to shared across projects & packages, you add added thos file under folder `packages/common-assets`. Then you can import your preferred assets with below example

```TypeScript
// In react project
import logo from "@common/assets/static/logo-brand.png";

<img src={logo} />

// In react native project
import { Image } from "react-native";

const logo = require("@common/assets/static/logo-brand.png");
<Image source={logo} />

```

---

## Translation

Translation locales can be shared among `cms`, `web` & `mobile` projects under `packages/common-locale`. You can have multiple locale files (JSON) within a language folder. This monorepo has come with two languanges by default, you may refer to the folder structure below & feel free to make changes

```
â”œâ”€â”€ cn
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ common.json
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ screen.json
â””â”€â”€ en
    â”œâ”€â”€ common.json
    â””â”€â”€ screen.json

```

We've provided a basic example below & this is how each JSON file should looks like.

```JSON
{
  "some-variable": "Using a variable {{message}}",
  "title": "Hello world",
}
```

Note: Please follow the ascending order for the key (A-Z, from top to bottom). You may use `yarn locale:fix` command for the fixes automatically

### Example

For `cms` & `web` project, you may refer the example below or checkout out [next-translate](https://github.com/vinissimus/next-translate) for more information.

```TypeScript
import setLanguage from "next-translate/setLanguage";
import useTranslation from "next-translate/useTranslation";

export default function SomeComponent() {
  const { t, lang } = useTranslation("common");

  return (
    <>
      <div>{t("language")}: {t(`language-${lang}`)}</div>
      <div>{t("poweredBy")}</div>
      <div>{t("some-variable", { message: "Hey" })}</div>

      {/* Switch Language */}
      <button onPress={() => setLanguage("en")}>
        {t("language-en")}
      </button>
      <button onPress={() => setLanguage("cn")}>
        {t("language-cn")}
      </button>
    </>
  );
}
```

For `mobile` projects, you can do refer to the example below

```TypeScript
import { Text } from "react-native";
import { Button } from "@ui/native";
import { useTranslation } from "i18n"; // <--- always import from "i18n"

export default function SomeComponent() {
  const { t, lang, setLanguage } = useTranslation("common");

  return (
    <>
      <Text>{t("language")}: {t(`language-${lang}`)}</Text>
      <Text>{t("poweredBy")}</Text>
      <Text>{t("some-variable", { message: "Hey" })}</Text>

      {/* Switch Language */}
      <Button onPress={() => setLanguage("en")}>
        {t("language-en")}
      </Button>
      <Button onPress={() => setLanguage("cn")}>
        {t("language-cn")}
      </Button>
    </>
  );
}
```

If you've noticed, the interface for the translation actually is quite similar for both `react` & `react-native` projects. But there are certains thing you guys have to take note

1. In `react-native` project (mobile) always import from `"i18n"`
2. In `react` projects (web, cms) please can refer to [next-translate](https://github.com/vinissimus/next-translate) documentation or above example
3. You can always use `setLanguage` method to switch language within projects, but there is some differences on implementation. Please checkout the example below:

```TypeScript
// in react project (web & cms)
import setLanguage from "next-translate/setLanguage";

setLanguage("en"); // within component

// in react-native project (mobile)
import { useTranslation } from "i18n";

const { t, lang, setLanguage } = useTranslation(); // within component
setLanguage("en")
```

## Theme

This monorepo enable theme configuration accross packages & projects. There were predefined setting under `packages/ui-theme` folder and below the folder structure

```
â”œâ”€â”€ src
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ config # constant values
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ colors
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ palette
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ spacing
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ tailwind # helper function for get tailwind styles with css name
â”œâ”€â”€ styles.json # tailwind styles for react native
â””â”€â”€ tailwind.config.js # tailwind configuration
```

For minimal usage, just modify constant values for ` colors`, `palatte`, `spacing` under `config` folder and you can access the value by importing the package. For example

```TypeScript
import { colors, palette, spacing } from "@ui/theme";

colors.primary // primary color
palette.black // black color

spacing.scale.sm // xs, sm, md, lg, xl, xxl
spacing.unit // px, rem, em

```

For advanced usage, please refer to upcoming section for Tailwind & Ant Design

### Tailwind

For tailwind theme configuration, you may update the `tailwind.config.js` under `packages/ui-theme` folder. The configuration will be shared accross `mobile` and `web` or other project that enable tailwind.

If you wish to have advanced configuration, please checkout the [official documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration) for customization.

**Note**: You can always run `yarn theme:viewer` to view theme configuration.

#### Example

To apply tailwind style for `react` or `react-native` project, you can do something like below:

```TypeScript
// in react-native project use with `@ui/theme` for styling
import { View } from "react-native";
import { Text } from "@ui/native";
import { tw } from "@ui/theme";

<View style={tw("bg-primary")}>
  <Text>View with primary color background</Text>
</View>

// if you are working on react project, just do as simple like below
<div className="bg-primary">
  View with primary color background
</div>
```

##### Caveat:

1. There are limited css classname supported for `React Native`, you can checkout this [repo](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/tailwind-rn#supported-utilities) for more information
2. Whenever there is updates on `tailwind.config.js`, please remember to run `yarn theme:generate` in order apply changes on `React Native`

### Ant Design

For Ant.Design theme configuration, you may update the `custom.less` under `projects/cms/styles` folder. Please refer to this [reference](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/blob/master/components/style/themes/default.less) if you need to overwrite the default styles.

---

## Reusable Components

In this skeleton there were few reusable components that created to be shared accross web & mobile project in purpose. There will be components added to this skeleton from time to time, please stay tuned and at the meantime you may check below section for existing component documentation

1. `Screen` - [documentation](./packages/ui-native/src/components/Screen/README.md)
2. `Button` - [documentation](./packages/ui-native/src/components/Button/README.md)
3. `Text` - [documentation](./packages/ui-native/src/components/Text/README.md)
4. `TextInput` - [documentation](./packages/ui-native/src/components/TextInput/README.md)
5. `LoginView` - [documentation](./packages/ui-native/src/components/Form/LoginView/README.md)

**Note: You may check `@ui/native` (packages/ui-native) packages for more information**

## GraphQL CodeGen

First step is change the schema url to your development server at `./packages/common-graphql/.codegen.yml`

```yml
schema: 'http://localhost:3000/graphql'
```

Second step find the operations file at `./packages/common-graphql/src/operations/index.graphql` and modify it, for example

```GraphQL
fragment UserInfo on User {
  id
  email
  firstName
  lastName
  phoneCode
  phoneNumber
  referralCode
}

query getAuthProfile {
  getAuthProfile {
    ...UserInfo
  }
}
```

Third Step is to generate the GraphQL Types, Documents, Hooks by running the command `yarn gql:generate`
![GraphQL Codegen](./docs/gql-generate.gif)

Fourth Step is to import any of Types, Documents, Hooks to your components or the places you wants to use it

```js
// example from src/config/getAuthProfile.ts
import get from 'lodash/get';
import { GetAuthProfileDocument } from '@common/graphql';
import { ApolloClient, NormalizedCacheObject } from '@apollo/client';

export default (
  apolloClient: ApolloClient<NormalizedCacheObject>
): Promise<{ authUser: any }> => {
  return apolloClient
    .query({
      query: GetAuthProfileDocument,
    })
    .then(({ data }) => {
      const authUser = get(data, 'getAuthProfile', null);
      return { authUser };
    })
    .catch(() => {
      // Fail gracefully
      return { authUser: null };
    });
};
```

# Deploy

1. Install vercel cli.
2. Authenticate your vercel account (tools@lavax.co)

```bash
# to deploy cms to vercel
yarn deploy:cms

# deploy cms to production
yarn deploy:cms --prod

# or deploy web
yarn deploy:web

# deploy web to production
yarn deploy:web --prod
```

## Setup vercel deployment (first time only)

note: change the `xxx` according to your project folder structure.

1. run `vercel` then setup the project. After that copy the .vercel folder into the respective `projects/xxx` folder.
2. change the 'scripts' in package.json to allow shortcut such as `"deploy:xxx": "cp -rf ./projects/xxx/.vercel ./ && vercel"`.
3. note: make sure you commit the code into the git repo. so the next person can just quickly run the command to deploy.
