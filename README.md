## Folder Structure

```
├── projects
│    ├── cms # cms panel
│    ├── mobile # end user mobile application
│    └── web # end user web application
└── libs
    ├── data-access # GraphQL Types, Documents, Hooks, etc
    ├── shared # Translation locale files
    │     ├── assets # Shared assets (images, locales)
    │     └── components # React Native UI Components
    └── ui-theme # theme configuration accross mobile & web (cms coming soon)
```

---

## Assets

If you have common assets that want to shared across projects & packages, you add added thos file under folder `libs/shared/assets`. Then you can import your preferred assets with below example

```TypeScript
// In react project
import logo from "@frontend-stack/assets/images/logo-brand.png";

<img src={logo} />

// In react native project
import { Image } from "react-native";

const logo = require("@frontend-stack/assets/images/logo-brand.png");
<Image source={logo} />

```

---

## Translation

Translation locales can be shared among `cms`, `web` & `mobile` projects under `libs/shared/assets/src/locales`. You can have multiple locale files (JSON) within a language folder. This monorepo has come with two languanges by default, you may refer to the folder structure below & feel free to make changes

```
├── cn
│   ├── common.json
│   └── screen.json
└── en
    ├── common.json
    └── screen.json

```

We've provided a basic example below & this is how each JSON file should looks like.

```JSON
{
  "some-variable": "Using a variable {{message}}",
  "title": "Hello world",
}
```

Note: Please follow the ascending order for the key (A-Z, from top to bottom). You may use `yarn locale:fix` command for the fixes automatically

### Example

For `cms` & `web` project, you may refer the example below or checkout out [next-translate](https://github.com/vinissimus/next-translate) for more information.

```TypeScript
import setLanguage from "next-translate/setLanguage";
import useTranslation from "next-translate/useTranslation";

export default function SomeComponent() {
  const { t, lang } = useTranslation("common");

  return (
    <>
      <div>{t("language")}: {t(`language-${lang}`)}</div>
      <div>{t("poweredBy")}</div>
      <div>{t("some-variable", { message: "Hey" })}</div>

      {/* Switch Language */}
      <button onPress={() => setLanguage("en")}>
        {t("language-en")}
      </button>
      <button onPress={() => setLanguage("cn")}>
        {t("language-cn")}
      </button>
    </>
  );
}
```

For `mobile` projects, you can do refer to the example below

```TypeScript
import { Text } from "react-native";
import { Button } from "@frontend-stack/shared/components";
import { useTranslation } from "i18n"; // <--- always import from "i18n"

export default function SomeComponent() {
  const { t, lang, setLanguage } = useTranslation("common");

  return (
    <>
      <Text>{t("language")}: {t(`language-${lang}`)}</Text>
      <Text>{t("poweredBy")}</Text>
      <Text>{t("some-variable", { message: "Hey" })}</Text>

      {/* Switch Language */}
      <Button onPress={() => setLanguage("en")}>
        {t("language-en")}
      </Button>
      <Button onPress={() => setLanguage("cn")}>
        {t("language-cn")}
      </Button>
    </>
  );
}
```

If you've noticed, the interface for the translation actually is quite similar for both `react` & `react-native` projects. But there are certains thing you guys have to take note

1. In `react-native` project (mobile) always import from `"i18n"`
2. In `react` projects (web, cms) please can refer to [next-translate](https://github.com/vinissimus/next-translate) documentation or above example
3. You can always use `setLanguage` method to switch language within projects, but there is some differences on implementation. Please checkout the example below:

```TypeScript
// in react project (web & cms)
import setLanguage from "next-translate/setLanguage";

setLanguage("en"); // within component

// in react-native project (mobile)
import { useTranslation } from "i18n";

const { t, lang, setLanguage } = useTranslation(); // within component
setLanguage("en")
```

You can check the table for

| Variable/Function        | Description                       | Web & CMS                                                                             | Mobile                                                       |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `t` (function)           | A function to get translated text | access via `useTranslation` react hooks (import from `next-translate/useTranslation`) | access via `useTranslation` react hooks (import from `i18n`) |
| `lang` (string)          | Current language                  | Same as above                                                                         | Same as above                                                |
| `setLanguage` (function) | A function for language switching | import from `next-translate/setLanguage`                                              | Same as above                                                |

## Theme

This monorepo enable theme configuration accross packages & projects. There were predefined setting under `packages/ui-theme` folder and below the folder structure

```
├── src
│   ├── config # constant values
│   │   ├── colors
│   │   ├── palette
│   │   └── spacing
│   └── tailwind # helper function for get tailwind styles with css name
├── styles.json # tailwind styles for react native
└── tailwind.config.js # tailwind configuration
```

For minimal usage, just modify constant values for ` colors`, `palatte`, `spacing` under `config` folder and you can access the value by importing the package. For example

```TypeScript
import { colors, palette, spacing } from "@frontend-stack/ui-theme";

colors.primary // primary color
palette.black // black color

spacing.scale.sm // xs, sm, md, lg, xl, xxl
spacing.unit // px, rem, em

```

For advanced usage, please refer to upcoming section for Tailwind & Ant Design

### Tailwind

For tailwind theme configuration, you may update the `tailwind.config.js` under `packages/ui-theme` folder. The configuration will be shared accross `mobile` and `web` or other project that enable tailwind.

If you wish to have advanced configuration, please checkout the [official documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration) for customization.

**Note**: You can always run `yarn theme:viewer` to view theme configuration.

#### Example

To apply tailwind style for `react` or `react-native` project, you can do something like below:

```TypeScript
// in react-native project use with `@frontend-stack/ui-theme` for styling
import { View } from "react-native";
import { Text } from "@frontend-stack/shared/components";
import { tw } from "@frontend-stack/ui-theme";

<View style={tw("bg-primary")}>
  <Text>View with primary color background</Text>
</View>

// if you are working on react project, just do as simple like below
<div className="bg-primary">
  View with primary color background
</div>
```

##### Caveat:

1. There are limited css classname supported for `React Native`, you can checkout this [repo](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/tailwind-rn#supported-utilities) for more information
2. Whenever there is updates on `tailwind.config.js`, please remember to run `yarn theme:generate` in order apply changes on `React Native`

### Ant Design

For Ant.Design theme configuration, you may update the `custom.less` under `projects/cms/styles` folder. Please refer to this [reference](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/blob/master/components/style/themes/default.less) if you need to overwrite the default styles.

## GraphQL CodeGen

First step is change the schema url to your development server at `./libs/data-access/.codegen.yml`

```yml
schema: 'http://localhost:3000/graphql'
```

Second step find the operations file at `./libs/data-access/src/operations/index.graphql` and modify it, for example

```GraphQL
fragment UserInfo on User {
  id
  email
  firstName
  lastName
  phoneCode
  phoneNumber
  referralCode
}

query getAuthProfile {
  getAuthProfile {
    ...UserInfo
  }
}
```

Third Step is to generate the GraphQL Types, Documents, Hooks by running the command `yarn generate:gql`
![GraphQL Codegen](./docs/gql-generate.gif)

Fourth Step is to import any of Types, Documents, Hooks to your components or the places you wants to use it

```js
// example from /apps/xxx/src/config/auth.query.ts
import get from 'lodash/get';
import { GetAuthProfileDocument } from '@frontend-stack/data-access';
import { ApolloClient, NormalizedCacheObject } from '@apollo/client';

export default (
  apolloClient: ApolloClient<NormalizedCacheObject>
): Promise<{ authUser: any }> => {
  return apolloClient
    .query({
      query: GetAuthProfileDocument,
    })
    .then(({ data }) => {
      const authUser = get(data, 'getAuthProfile', null);
      return { authUser };
    })
    .catch(() => {
      // Fail gracefully
      return { authUser: null };
    });
};
```

# Deploy

1. Install vercel cli.
2. Authenticate your vercel account (tools@lavax.co)

```bash
# to deploy cms to vercel
yarn deploy:cms

# deploy cms to production
yarn deploy:cms --prod

# or deploy web
yarn deploy:web

# deploy web to production
yarn deploy:web --prod
```

## Setup vercel deployment (first time only)

note: change the `xxx` according to your project folder structure.

1. run `vercel` then setup the project. After that copy the .vercel folder into the respective `projects/xxx` folder.
2. change the 'scripts' in package.json to allow shortcut such as `"deploy:xxx": "cp -rf ./projects/xxx/.vercel ./ && vercel"`.
3. note: make sure you commit the code into the git repo. so the next person can just quickly run the command to deploy.
